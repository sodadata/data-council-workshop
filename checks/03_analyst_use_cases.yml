checks for CUSTOMERS:

  # SQL-engine specific aggregation functions available! (non trivial in a generic solution)
  - stddev_samp(size) between 3.26 and 3.27
  - variance(size) between 10.65 and 10.66
  - var_samp(size) between 10.65 and 10.66
  - percentile(distance, 0.7) = 999

  # First example of a template check for a particular use case.
  - values in (country, zip) must exist in ZIP_CODES (country, zip)

  # Often requested: apply checks on a filter
  - valid_count(pct) = 2:
      valid format: percentage
      missing values: [No value, N/A, error]
      filter: cat = 'HIGH' and country = 'BE'

  # Custom metric with name and warn levels
  - size_dst:
      name: Absolute average size and distance product must be < 1000000
      size_dst expression: ABS(AVG(size * distance))
      warn: when > 1000000
      fail: when > 1500000

# If we haven't easy language coverage for it (yet!), SQL gives the ultimate flexibility
checks:
  - failed rows:
      name: High customers must have size
      fail query: |
        SELECT *
        FROM ORDERS as O
             JOIN CUSTOMERS as C on O.customer_id_ok = C.id
        WHERE C.cat = 'HIGH'
              AND C.size > 0
