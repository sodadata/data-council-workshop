checks for CUSTOMERS:

  # Detailed schema expectations control
  - schema:
      fail:
        when required column missing: ['id', 'size', 'distance']
        when forbidden column present: ['email_address', 'pii_%']
        when wrong column type:
          id: varchar
          distance: integer
        when wrong column index:
          id: 0

      # And/or simple notifications on any schema change:
      warn:
        when schema changes: any

  # Change over time requires a metric store
  - change avg last 7 for row_count < 50

  # Simple failed rows expression for a table
  # Captures the failed rows as diagnostic information
  # Performance considerations -> aggregation query
  - failed rows:
      name: High customers must have size less than 3
      fail condition: cat = 'HIGH' and size >= 3

  # Cross data source row count comparison. (can't be done as an afterthought)
  - row_count same as CUSTOMERS_UPSTREAM in other_workshop_ds


# Partitions are crucial for large, incremental datasets
filter ORDERS [daily]:
  where: TIMESTAMP '${START}' <= created_at AND created_at < '${END}'

checks for ORDERS [daily]:
  - row_count > 0
  - freshness using created_at < 2h


# Specify checks to be applied on a collection of tables
for each table T:
  tables:
    - CUSTOME%
    - ORDERS
  checks:
    - row_count > 0
